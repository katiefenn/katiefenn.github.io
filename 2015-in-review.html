<p><em>27th December 2015</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve never written an annual review before, but because this year has been a turnaround year for me, and because I&#39;ve been inspired by <a href="http://www.kitation.co.uk/">Chad&#39;s writing</a>, now seems like a good time to start.</p>
<h3 id="cool-things">Cool Things</h3>
<p>In February, First Play Sheffield raised Â£500 for <a href="http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/">Special Effect</a> by taking part in GameBlast, a twenty-four hour videogame marathon. I <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569182399600451584">almost</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569264266097917952">completed</a> a <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569300753405349889">full</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569348291453980672">run</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569406065198153728">of</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569441484786823168">Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>
<p>My album of the year and film of the year are both space-related, being <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/65KwtzkJXw7oT819NFWmEP">The Race for Space</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28film%29">The Martian</a>. Both are love letters to the golden age of space exploration and capture all of the drama and euphoria.</p>
<p>I starting diving lessons at Ponds Forge. It was a hobby that I&#39;d dipped my toe into when I was young, and I have always wanted to take it seriously. Diving is unique; the excitement and focus shakes a difficult week of work out of you, and it&#39;s the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.</p>
<h3 id="the-lead-experiment">The Lead Experiment</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying out the lead developer role in 2014 and 2015. I&#39;ve helmed two projects, I&#39;m very proud to have guided them to completion and to have worked such talented, hard working people.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve enjoyed many of the challenges that the lead position brings. We replaced a clumsy desktop / mobile site with <a href="https://www.missguided.co.uk/">a single responsive site</a>, simplifying the technology while introducing a crisp, modern design. We also introduced Sass, Grunt, Patternlab and SVG graphics. The key to the success of the project was a close relationship between designers and developers, involving both in planning meetings and pairing up to make sure the design worked as well as it looked.</p>
<p>Staying on top of such large changes with a geographically divided team was hard work, and although planning everything was an interesting experience, I regretted spending such a long time away from programming. I was very unhappy with the direction my career was taking, and losing out in several interviews for development jobs I wanted very much because of a lack of recent experience hurt.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-the-old-ways">Back to the Old Ways</h3>
<p>I left behind many good friends at <a href="http://inviqa.com/">Inviqa</a> and took a full-time Javascript role at <a href="http://skybetcareers.com/about-us">Sky Betting and Gaming</a>. I&#39;ve since been working on a cutting-edge <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> app, with lots of new ideas such as <a href="https://github.com/glenjamin/fluctuations">Flux</a>, functional programming and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">immutable data structures</a>. The last six months have made me realise how rusty I&#39;d become, and how much I enjoyed writing code again.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also had two pull requests merged into <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, and I&#39;m working on another for <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en">Chrome DevTools</a>. The warmth these communities have shown me has convinced me to increase participation in community development in 2016. This will be at the expense of solo efforts like <a href="http://github.com/katiefenn/parker/">Parker</a>, but I think I will be a lot happier being part of something bigger.</p>
<h3 id="part-of-something-big">Part of Something Big</h3>

<p>My hope for 2016 is to write more articles, write more talks, and write more pull requests.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year.</p>
