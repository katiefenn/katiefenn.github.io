<p><em>27th December 2015</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve never written an annual review before, but because this year has been a turnaround year for me, and because I&#39;ve been inspired by <a href="http://www.kitation.co.uk/">Chad&#39;s writing</a>, now seems like a good time to start.</p>
<h3 id="cool-things">Cool Things</h3>
<p>In February, First Play Sheffield raised Â£500 for <a href="http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/">Special Effect</a> by taking part in GameBlast, a twenty-four hour videogame marathon. I <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569182399600451584">almost</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569264266097917952">completed</a> a <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569300753405349889">full</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569348291453980672">run</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569406065198153728">of</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/569441484786823168">Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>
<p>My album of the year and film of the year are both space-related, being <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/65KwtzkJXw7oT819NFWmEP">The Race for Space</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28film%29">The Martian</a>. Both are love letters to the golden age of space exploration and capture all of the drama and euphoria.</p>
<p>I starting diving lessons at Ponds Forge. It was a hobby that I&#39;d dipped my toe into when I was young, and I have always wanted to take it seriously. Diving is unique; the excitement and focus shakes a difficult week of work out of you, and it&#39;s the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.</p>
<h3 id="the-lead-experiment">The Lead Experiment</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying out the lead developer role in 2014 and 2015. I&#39;ve helmed two projects, I&#39;m very proud to have guided them to completion and to have worked such talented, hard working people.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve enjoyed many of the challenges that the lead position brings. We replaced a clumsy desktop / mobile site with <a href="https://www.missguided.co.uk/">a single responsive site</a>, simplifying the technology while introducing a crisp, modern design. We also introduced Sass, Grunt, Patternlab and SVG graphics. The key to the success of the project was a close relationship between designers and developers, involving both in planning meetings and pairing up to make sure the design worked as well as it looked.</p>
<p>Staying on top of such large changes with a geographically divided team was hard work, and although planning everything was an interesting experience, I regretted spending such a long time away from programming. I was very unhappy with the direction my career was taking, and losing out in several interviews for development jobs I wanted very much because of a lack of recent experience hurt.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-the-old-ways">Back to the Old Ways</h3>
<p>I left behind many good friends at <a href="http://inviqa.com/">Inviqa</a> and took a full-time Javascript role at <a href="http://skybetcareers.com/about-us">Sky Betting and Gaming</a>. I&#39;ve since been working on a cutting-edge <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> app, with lots of new ideas such as <a href="https://github.com/glenjamin/fluctuations">Flux</a>, functional programming and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">immutable data structures</a>. The last six months have made me realise how rusty I&#39;d become, and how much I enjoyed writing code again.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also had two pull requests merged into <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, and I&#39;m working on another for <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en">Chrome DevTools</a>. The warmth these communities have shown me has convinced me to increase participation in community development in 2016. This will be at the expense of solo efforts like <a href="http://github.com/katiefenn/parker/">Parker</a>, but I think I will be a lot happier being part of something bigger.</p>
<h3 id="part-of-something-big">Part of Something Big</h3>
<p>The highlight of 2015 has been visiting and speaking at some amazing events (in rough chronological order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Leeds JS*</li>
<li>Sheffield JS*</li>
<li>Scotland JS*</li>
<li>Up Front</li>
<li>Manchester JS*</li>
<li>Manchester Girl Geeks Barcamp **</li>
<li>McrFRED*</li>
<li>Reject JS **</li>
<li>JS Conf EU</li>
<li>CSS Conf EU</li>
<li>Frontend London*</li>
</ul>
<p>* Speaking
** Speaking (lightning talk)</p>
<p>The community continues to be the most fulfilling thing about being a developer. There are many cool people out there who are doing some incredible work. It makes me proud to have spoken at some of those events.</p>

<p>My hope for 2016 is to write more articles, write more talks, and write more pull requests.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p>

<p><em>26th July 2015</em></p>
<p>Since last year, I have been taking a keen interest in <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, the new blogging platform built on Node.JS. I&#39;ve been fortunate to contribute to the project, and I&#39;m planning on continuing to donate some of my time and experience.</p>
<p>Migrating my website to Ghost is a great way of getting to know it a bit better, as well as providing an opportunity to write extensions and supporting tools.</p>
<p>At the same time, an audit of my old website showed it was significantly behind-the-times. An early attempt at building a high-dpi design did not go as well as planned. Here are the figures:</p>
<p><strong>Total requests:</strong> 18
<strong>Total requests size:</strong> 1.6MB
<strong>Time to load (fiber):</strong> 582ms</p>
<p><em>Ouch.</em> Not good.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#39;ve learned how great <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/">SVGs</a> are to work with, so I decided a ground-up redesign with Adobe Illustrator was necessary.</p>
<h3 id="svgs">SVGs</h3>
<p>Smaller filesizes and great looking images on high-dpi displays make SVGs a good choice for developers.</p>
<p>More than this, I found Adobe Illustrator a surprisingly good tool for creating graphics for the web. Vector graphics packages are good at creating the clean lines and bold shapes that are common on the web. Being able to adjust vector shapes is really useful when tweaking and optimising designs, which is an important part of designing great web sites.</p>
<h3 id="data-uri-images">Data URI Images</h3>
<p>Embedding images into stylesheets reduces the number of HTTP requests, meaning faster loading sites. The smaller size of SVG images means embedding them inside stylesheets places a smaller burden on their overall filesize.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also chosen to make the main heading an SVG image instead of adding an extra request to a web font for just a single element.</p>
<h3 id="responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve paid extra-special attention to how the design responds to mobile devices. On medium devices, the decoration becomes static to make better use of the space. On mobiles, the decorative elements are hidden and the content and typography takes precedence.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> to save articles for later reading, and love the focused reading experience it gives. It was this experience I wanted to give all readers of my site on mobiles.</p>
<h3 id="ghost">Ghost</h3>
<p>Ghost makes a change from my previous platform of choice. I liked the simplicity of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, particularly its support for generating pages from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> source files.</p>
<p>My choice of Ghost is primarily made to support my contributions to the platform, but its support for Markdown authoring leaves the door open for importing content from files or services in the future.</p>
<h3 id="platform">Platform</h3>
<p>Even after all of this, a significant effort has been made to completely re-platform my site.</p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> to provision a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> droplet. Using automated provisioning gives a useful interface for making incremental changes to your setup, which is especially useful when you have a lot to learn about devops like I have.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the combination of <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> and <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> for the base OS and web server. I&#39;ve been working with both for four years, and both have proven to be dependable and easy to work with for those with limited time to spend.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s what impact the improvements have made to the performance:</p>
<p><strong>Total requests:</strong> 8
<strong>Total requests size:</strong> 109KB
<strong>Time to load (fiber):</strong> 445ms</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I&#39;m pleased with the improvement in performance, and happy to finally put the site to work. The re-platforming took longer than expected but paid off with a set of Ansible playbooks I can re-use and build on. Deciding when a project is <em>done</em> is always a problem, and <strong>this site is not done</strong>. But it is <em>ready</em>, and I am pleased to show not only a website that looks good but also works well.</p>

<p><em>20th February 2013</em></p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10951040">interesting report on BBC News</a> on A-Level Computing students using BBC Micros to learn computer programming.</p>
<p>I think BBC Micros made excellent computers to learn to program on because learning to program was always a central function of the product. The relative simplicity of contemporary computer game software and a well-documented BASIC interpreter were also important features.</p>
<p>It is these qualities that remind me of Google Android, Appleâs IOS and the Web. These devices seem to carry on the tradition of the bedroom coder; to go beyond owning a product and to begin learning how it works and how to write your own software. These devices are often fondly remembered by their owners and leave an important legacy. The BBC Micro was that device for me.</p>

<p><em>11th July 2011</em></p>
<p>I have been making websites for a long time. I have never hosted any of them, until this year.</p>
<p>My employerâs hardware cupboard is an Aladdinâs cave of Apple hardware. When it was last cleaned out, I was lucky enough to adopt an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4_Cube">Apple Power Mac G4 Cube</a>. It wouldâve been beautiful new, but the reality distortion field has no kind effect on ageing hardware. The transparent, acrylic case was cracked, but it still started up.</p>
<p>Iâd had the best intentions of operating my own web server for years. What had stopped me was the lack of support for static IP addresses in consumer broadband packages and the lack of appropriate hardware. Now that <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/broadband/">O2</a> support static IP addresses in their consumer broadband packages, I had a chance. The Cubeâs passively-cooled hardware, famously dispersing its heat by the convection of air through a vent that runs from the bottom of the system to the top, immediately appealed to me.</p>
<p>The Cube was old, though such machines can thrive as webservers. HTTP servers have been written for many platforms, including many aging systems and formats. The Cube wasnât going to be the oldest webserver in the world by a long way. The <a href="http://www.c64web.com/">C64 webserver</a> is an example, although probably not the most archaic.</p>
<p>Its age did create a few problems. It came with a vintage install of Mac OS X 10.3 Panther. Panther felt surprisingly zippy and responsive when it booted, although it was too old to run MacPorts, Mac OS Xâs popular open-source port project. To install <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, I would need OS X 10.4 Tiger as a minimum.</p>
<p>A copy of Tiger wasnât hard to find. Once installed, the 2005-vintage operating system was thankfully responsive and stable. After installing MacPorts, it is simply a case of invoking the installation of PHP5, MySQL and Apache through the command-line interface.</p>
<p>It was here that the Cube really began to show its age. In total, it took the Cube the better part of twelve hours to compile and install the PHP/MySQL/Apache stack. Iâm also feeling pinched for space â my Cube has a noisy 20GB hard disk drive, and the system files and applications account for around 10G alone.</p>
<p>Thatâs plenty for my needs, though. Now I have a web server of my own, that I can configure and operate to my heartâs content. I get good amounts of uptime, I get administrator access, I have no competing virtually-hosted sites draining performance.</p>
<p>If youâve got a dusty piece of computer hardware that youâve got in the back of a cupboard, I highly recommend that you try making your own webserver. <a href="http://2tbsp.com/content/install_apache_2_and_php_5_macports">You can find the guide that I used here</a>. MacPorts makes it easy. I daresay Apt is very friendly too. Youâll get so much value out of computers that up until yesterday did nothing.</p>
