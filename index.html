<p><em>28th July 2018</em></p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/scotland-js-retrospective/lanyards.jpg" alt="My Scotland JS lanyards"></p>
<p>It was an emotional moment when <a href="https://twitter.com/jiggy_pete">Peter Aitken</a> announced that the 2018 edition of <a href="Scotland JS">http://scotlandjs.com/</a> was to be the last. This is not a normal reaction to the end of a tech conference, but Scotland JS is not just a normal event.</p>
<p>I became involved with Scotland JS in early 2015. I&#39;d delivered my first conference talk during the autumn of 2014, and was wondering where to go next. Peter had started holding video calls with aspiring speakers to talk to them about the conference, about the call-for-papers (CFP) process and the kinds of topics attendees wanted to see.</p>
<p>The calls were designed to reach out to underrepresented people in the tech industry, to encourage them not just to attend the conference but to step up to the stage and speak. It was the first time I&#39;d thought &quot;oh, you mean me!&quot; when deciding to submit a talk to a CFP.</p>
<h3 id="getting-selected">Getting selected</h3>
<p>I soon discovered that Scotland JS has a unique talk selection process. All talks submitted to the CFP program are voted on by early-bird ticket holders. Ticket holders would also vote on the talk titles and abstracts alone - they would have no idea who would be speaking. Submitting a talk to a CFP was a daunting prospect, but the anonymity of the CFP process was reassuring. Nobody would know I&#39;m a newbie.</p>
<p>As it turns out, my talk was selected. Having my talk picked out by the very people who were going to see my talk boosted my confidence immensely.</p>
<p>The first day of Scotland JS 2015 was <em>tremendously</em> exciting. It was the first time I&#39;d met international speakers and stood on stage with them. I made friends with <a href="https://twitter.com/jiggy_pete">Peter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nattarnoff">Nat Tarnoff</a>. I felt like I <em>belonged there</em>.</p>
<p>The standout talks that year were <a href="https://twitter.com/lrnrd?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Lena Reinhard&#39;s</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl8OWGbZTsM">Talk about Nothing</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lewiscowper">Lewis Cowper&#39;s</a> talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6OsD60ne0w">From Forklift Driver to Developer</a> and Nat Tarnoff&#39;s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfiNP8iWDSo&amp;t=304s">The UX of Stairs</a>. The message was clear: Scotland JS is a conference committed to <em>making the world a better place for everyone</em>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-involved">Getting involved</h3>
<p>At the Scotland JS 2015 afterparty, I asked Peter if I could get involved with the next event. I even offered to sweep the floor afterwards if he wanted me to. I&#39;ve said this to a few conference organisers, but in 2016 Scotland JS was the first to say yes. Thankfully I didn&#39;t have to sweep the floor, so instead I looked after speakers and watched the registration desk.</p>
<p>Scotland JS 2016 was also the first time we&#39;d put a lot of time and effort into enforcing a code of conduct, and educating speakers about inclusive language. On top of this, I was picking up duties as a speaker at the inaugural Scotland CSS event.</p>
<p>Among the standout talks were <a href="https://twitter.com/varjmes">James Spencer&#39;s</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/hf7NXDbF5zw">Your First PR</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rmehner">Robin Mehner&#39;s</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/r2kT7En-vTw">Surviving JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kitation">Chad Gowler&#39;s</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/Id68Zq3baMI">How to Ask About Gender</a>.</p>
<p>I remember the 2016 event as one of the one of the most tiring weeks of my life. The day begins at 6:45 in order to get to the venue at 7:30 before attendees arrive. If you want to go out for a drink at the end of the day, you have to choose between socialising and a good night&#39;s sleep.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/varjmes/status/1023862200174297089">Take more naps</a>&quot; was the number one theme among speakers and volunteers that week. Taking time out of talks to go back to the hotel for a nap is such an important piece of advice! Sadly, it is advice that is very hard to follow as an organiser or a volunteer. It was a glimpse into the enormous amount of work that organisers like Peter put into their events.</p>
<h3 id="getting-to-the-end">Getting to the end</h3>
<p>I had my suspicions that end was coming for Scotland JS when we all took a break in 2017. It was a pleasant surprise when Peter announced that the conference would happen again in 2018, but a surprise nevertheless.</p>
<p>The prelude for the conference was the phenomenally successful <a href="https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/">Global Diversity CFP Day</a>. This extended the gesture of reaching out to speakers around the entire world. On the day, there were 50 events in cities around the globe.</p>
<p>The conference itself was one of the most enjoyable I&#39;ve ever been to. We had more speakers than ever before from outside the usual frontend speaker community. My favourite talks of the week were <a href="https://twitter.com/senorhuidobro">Ramon Huidobro&#39;s</a> talk about teaching kids to code and <a href="https://twitter.com/KimCrayton1">Kim Crayton&#39;s</a> surprise closing keynote calling out systemic racism in tech.</p>
<p>Scotland JS has always been a platform given to those who are creating good tech and those who are <em>doing good</em> in tech. We desperately need to remind ourselves of the opporunities and responsibility to use tech for good, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files">now more than ever</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-to-the-point">Getting to the point</h3>
<p>Scotland JS has been a part of my life for almost four years. I&#39;ve written three talks that have been delivered there. I&#39;ve organised two Global Diversity CFP events. I&#39;ve met so many people who are doing important work to make life better for so many marginalised people. I met inspiring people who worked at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> who I would later go on to work with.</p>
<p>None of this would be possible without the hard work of all the conference volunteers and above all Peter Aitken. At the registration desk for Scotland JS, there are many badges carrying the label &quot;speaker&quot; and &quot;volunteer&quot;. There is only one badge that is labelled &quot;organiser&quot;, and that is Peter&#39;s badge. Being a lone organiser is an incredibly hard and tiring job and Peter is one of the hardest-working, most caring people in tech.</p>
<p>The very first time I ever met Peter, he reached out and encouraged me to take part in something very special. I&#39;ve never seen him when he hasn&#39;t been reaching out to someone. I now need to book a holiday in Scotland so I can go visit him as a friend.</p>
<p>Thanks for it all, Peter 💙.</p>

<p><em>5th February 2017</em></p>
<p>I have been using React to build sites for nearly two years. It&#39;s a valuable tool for making cutting-edge software with vibrant user experiences and I have grown used to using it. It&#39;s not normally the tool you would use for a small development blog, but how would you go about using it if you did?</p>
<p>React is famous for introducing universally rendered JS components - HTML content rendered symmetrically on the server and in the browser. Rendering components only in the browser can be slow, and doing part of it on the server is a useful shortcut.</p>
<pre><code>let output = ReactDOM.renderToString(
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
);
</code></pre><p>This makes React a useful HTML templating tool that we can use in the same role as Handlebars, Twig or Haml. React is remarkably relaxed about how and where you use it, and I want to take advantage of this as the basis of my super-modern static site generator.</p>
<p>I also have an ulterior motive. Much has been said about using tools like React to make sophisticated &quot;single page apps&quot;. While it is true that React is a superb tool for this, there is a majority of developers who don&#39;t work on SPAs who really want to know what the latest tools can do for them.</p>
<h3 id="gulp">Gulp</h3>
<p>Before we get started with React, we need a static site generator to build our site around. The only one I&#39;ve used before is <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which is a great tool for beginners but its prescriptive design doesn&#39;t give me any options to use my own tools. On the other hand, Gulp is designed especially for producing bespoke sites and its library of plugins allows me to replicate common static site features such as Markdown parsing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-markdown">gulp-markdown</a> is used just for this purpose. It transforms markdown files into HTML, and is the first step in turning my articles into web pages.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename">gulp-rename</a> to strip date prefixes from the folders that contain my articles. I also use it to rename the main article files to <code>index.html</code> to make requests to <code>article-name/index.html</code> load with a friendly URL like <code>www.katiefenn.co.uk/article-name/</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sort">gulp-sort</a> orders my articles so that they appear in my index files in reverse date order, using the date prefixes on the article directory names.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-filter">gulp-filter</a> is useful for making Gulp ignore other files stored with my articles, such as images and notes that I don&#39;t want to publish.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-replace">gulp-replace</a> is perfect for adding permalinks to article headings.</p>
<p>These plugins are <em>almost</em> enough to make a basic static site work, all that&#39;s left is to inject the processed content into an HTML template to make it look nice. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-filter">gulp-handlebars</a> is a good way of doing this normally, but this is where I start doing things differently.</p>
<h3 id="custom-render-to-html-plugin">Custom render-to-html plugin</h3>
<p>As far as I know, there are no Gulp plugins to render piped HTML content into React components (know better? <a href="http://twitter.com/katie_fenn">Let me know!</a>). The custom plugin I wrote for doing this, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-render-to-string">gulp-render-to-string</a>, takes HTML piped into it, creates a new instance of a React element with props from its arguments, and renders it to a string.</p>
<pre><code>// Inject article content into site templates
// (server-rendered React components)
.pipe(jsxTemplate(PageIndex, {
  pageCount: Math.ceil(articleCount / ARTICLES_PER_PAGE)
}))
.pipe(jsxTemplate(Page))
</code></pre><p>Looking inside the source of the plugin, we can see that it encapsulates <code>ReactDom.renderToString</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let contents = file.contents.toString(&quot;utf8&quot;);
let output = ReactDOM.renderToString(
  &lt;Component {...props}&gt;
    { contents }
  &lt;/Component&gt;
);

file.contents = new Buffer(output);
</code></pre><p>There&#39;s just one part of the puzzle missing for making a working blog: paginated index pages.</p>
<h3 id="custom-pagination-plugin">Custom pagination plugin</h3>
<p>Navigation of articles on my site has always been through collating articles into numbered pages. It&#39;s a common method of navigating blog-like sites, and I am somewhat surprised that a Gulp plugin does not exist to do this.</p>
<p>I created another custom Gulp plugin, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-paginate">gulp-paginate</a>, that holds files piped into it until the number of articles held reaches a configurable articles-per-page setting. It then creates a new file with content from each file it holds appended together.</p>
<h3 id="css-modules-and-postcss">CSS Modules and PostCSS</h3>
<p>CSS Modules is one of the most exciting new developments in the world of CSS. It is a suite of tools that protect styles from being freely overwritten. This helps reduce the problem of unexpected side-effects when making changes to a site&#39;s styles. It also compliments building a site with React, by placing a focus on reusable user interface components instead of reusable styles.</p>
<p>CSS Modules is supported by both <a href="http://postcss.org/">PostCSS</a> and <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">WebPack</a>. I decided not to use WebPack because my site has few client-side assets that need bundling. PostCSS is ideal in this case, it can pre-process modular stylesheets for a static website and is easier to set up than WebPack.</p>
<p>When PostCSS processes my stylesheets, it transforms classnames to make them unique. It&#39;s a similar process to the <a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</a> naming convention in that it adds a postfix to classes to reduce the likelihood of style being overwritten. In order to use the new classnames in my React components, PostCSS creates a JSON file that maps the old classes to the new:</p>
<pre><code>import React from &#39;react&#39;;
const styles = require(&#39;./styles.css.json&#39;);

export default function(props) {
  return (
    &lt;article className={ styles.article } /&gt;
  );
};
</code></pre><p>The end result HTML looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;article class=&quot;_article_1jkjk_1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Building a static website with React&lt;/h1&gt;
  ...
&lt;/article&gt;
</code></pre><p>Gulp then concatenates stylesheets together into a single file to be served on the web.</p>
<h3 id="automating-builds-and-deployment-with-travis-ci">Automating builds and deployment with Travis CI</h3>
<p>One of the pain points of making a static website in the past was the manual process of generating and deploying the site whenever content changed. <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> once again proves an invaluable frontend development tool by doing this bit for me.</p>
<p>My introduction to CI was a service than ran unit tests on my code whenever I pushed to GitHub. The sheer flexibility of modern CI services (such as Travis) allows them to do much more than this. Whenever I push a change to <a href="https://github.com/katiefenn/website-2017-src">my site&#39;s repository</a> on GitHub, Travis builds my site and deploys the <a href="https://github.com/katiefenn/katiefenn.github.io">built code</a> to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. The built code is never committed to the source repository.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/domenic/ec8b0fc8ab45f39403dd">Dominic Denicola&#39;s article</a> explains the entire process for setting this up.</p>
<h3 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h3>
<p>Some things that I hope to work on that can improve the site in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTPS support with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a></li>
<li>HTTP2 support and private hosting with <a href="https://github.com/mholt/caddy">Caddy</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-summary">In Summary</h3>
<p>Frontend tooling is steaming ahead at a breathtaking pace. It&#39;s easy to <a href="https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.907fj8lg6">become disillusioned</a> with the latest tools, and there have been times when I felt permanently left behind by the community.</p>
<p>As tools like React have matured, the community have started filling in the blanks to make them more flexible for use outside of single page applications. Although there is still work to be done, I found React and Gulp to be great substitute for Jekyll. The process of writing custom Gulp plugins was not as accessible as I&#39;d hoped, and I would encourage the community to develop a stripped-down alternative API for creating plugins.</p>
<p>The best thing about the project was taking ownership of every aspect of the site. I loved using Ghost and Jekyll in the past, but with so much happening &quot;under the hood&quot; there is a reduced incentive for customisation. The recent trend for creating numerous small modules does a lot to break down the walls of what would otherwise be an opaque box.</p>
<p>I hope this trend continues, especially if it is matched by the community making tooling intuitive and accessible.</p>

<p>I starting diving lessons at Ponds Forge. It was a hobby that I&#39;d dipped my toe into when I was young, and I have always wanted to take it seriously. Diving is unique; the excitement and focus shakes a difficult week of work out of you, and it&#39;s the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.</p>
<h3 id="the-lead-experiment">The Lead Experiment</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying out the lead developer role in 2014 and 2015. I&#39;ve helmed two projects, I&#39;m very proud to have guided them to completion and to have worked such talented, hard working people.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve enjoyed many of the challenges that the lead position brings. We replaced a clumsy desktop / mobile site with <a href="https://www.missguided.co.uk/">a single responsive site</a>, simplifying the technology while introducing a crisp, modern design. We also introduced Sass, Grunt, Patternlab and SVG graphics. The key to the success of the project was a close relationship between designers and developers, involving both in planning meetings and pairing up to make sure the design worked as well as it looked.</p>
<p>Staying on top of such large changes with a geographically divided team was hard work, and although planning everything was an interesting experience, I regretted spending such a long time away from programming. I was very unhappy with the direction my career was taking, and losing out in several interviews for development jobs I wanted very much because of a lack of recent experience hurt.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-the-old-ways">Back to the Old Ways</h3>
<p>I left behind many good friends at <a href="http://inviqa.com/">Inviqa</a> and took a full-time Javascript role at <a href="http://skybetcareers.com/about-us">Sky Betting and Gaming</a>. I&#39;ve since been working on a cutting-edge <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> app, with lots of new ideas such as <a href="https://github.com/glenjamin/fluctuations">Flux</a>, functional programming and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">immutable data structures</a>. The last six months have made me realise how rusty I&#39;d become, and how much I enjoyed writing code again.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also had two pull requests merged into <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, and I&#39;m working on another for <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en">Chrome DevTools</a>. The warmth these communities have shown me has convinced me to increase participation in community development in 2016. This will be at the expense of solo efforts like <a href="http://github.com/katiefenn/parker/">Parker</a>, but I think I will be a lot happier being part of something bigger.</p>
<h3 id="part-of-something-big">Part of Something Big</h3>

<p><em>26th July 2015</em></p>
<p>Since last year, I have been taking a keen interest in <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, the new blogging platform built on Node.JS. I&#39;ve been fortunate to contribute to the project, and I&#39;m planning on continuing to donate some of my time and experience.</p>
<p>Migrating my website to Ghost is a great way of getting to know it a bit better, as well as providing an opportunity to write extensions and supporting tools.</p>
<p>At the same time, an audit of my old website showed it was significantly behind-the-times. An early attempt at building a high-dpi design did not go as well as planned. Here are the figures:</p>
<p><strong>Total requests:</strong> 18
<strong>Total requests size:</strong> 1.6MB
<strong>Time to load (fiber):</strong> 582ms</p>
<p><em>Ouch.</em> Not good.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#39;ve learned how great <a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/">SVGs</a> are to work with, so I decided a ground-up redesign with Adobe Illustrator was necessary.</p>
<h3 id="svgs">SVGs</h3>
<p>Smaller filesizes and great looking images on high-dpi displays make SVGs a good choice for developers.</p>
<p>More than this, I found Adobe Illustrator a surprisingly good tool for creating graphics for the web. Vector graphics packages are good at creating the clean lines and bold shapes that are common on the web. Being able to adjust vector shapes is really useful when tweaking and optimising designs, which is an important part of designing great web sites.</p>
<h3 id="data-uri-images">Data URI Images</h3>
<p>Embedding images into stylesheets reduces the number of HTTP requests, meaning faster loading sites. The smaller size of SVG images means embedding them inside stylesheets places a smaller burden on their overall filesize.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also chosen to make the main heading an SVG image instead of adding an extra request to a web font for just a single element.</p>
<h3 id="responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve paid extra-special attention to how the design responds to mobile devices. On medium devices, the decoration becomes static to make better use of the space. On mobiles, the decorative elements are hidden and the content and typography takes precedence.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> to save articles for later reading, and love the focused reading experience it gives. It was this experience I wanted to give all readers of my site on mobiles.</p>
<h3 id="ghost">Ghost</h3>
<p>Ghost makes a change from my previous platform of choice. I liked the simplicity of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, particularly its support for generating pages from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> source files.</p>
<p>My choice of Ghost is primarily made to support my contributions to the platform, but its support for Markdown authoring leaves the door open for importing content from files or services in the future.</p>
<h3 id="platform">Platform</h3>
<p>Even after all of this, a significant effort has been made to completely re-platform my site.</p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> to provision a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> droplet. Using automated provisioning gives a useful interface for making incremental changes to your setup, which is especially useful when you have a lot to learn about devops like I have.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the combination of <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> and <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> for the base OS and web server. I&#39;ve been working with both for four years, and both have proven to be dependable and easy to work with for those with limited time to spend.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s what impact the improvements have made to the performance:</p>
<p><strong>Total requests:</strong> 8
<strong>Total requests size:</strong> 109KB
<strong>Time to load (fiber):</strong> 445ms</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I&#39;m pleased with the improvement in performance, and happy to finally put the site to work. The re-platforming took longer than expected but paid off with a set of Ansible playbooks I can re-use and build on. Deciding when a project is <em>done</em> is always a problem, and <strong>this site is not done</strong>. But it is <em>ready</em>, and I am pleased to show not only a website that looks good but also works well.</p>

<p><em>20th February 2013</em></p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10951040">interesting report on BBC News</a> on A-Level Computing students using BBC Micros to learn computer programming.</p>
<p>I think BBC Micros made excellent computers to learn to program on because learning to program was always a central function of the product. The relative simplicity of contemporary computer game software and a well-documented BASIC interpreter were also important features.</p>
<p>It is these qualities that remind me of Google Android, Apple’s IOS and the Web. These devices seem to carry on the tradition of the bedroom coder; to go beyond owning a product and to begin learning how it works and how to write your own software. These devices are often fondly remembered by their owners and leave an important legacy. The BBC Micro was that device for me.</p>

<p><em>11th July 2011</em></p>
<p>I have been making websites for a long time. I have never hosted any of them, until this year.</p>
<p>My employer’s hardware cupboard is an Aladdin’s cave of Apple hardware. When it was last cleaned out, I was lucky enough to adopt an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4_Cube">Apple Power Mac G4 Cube</a>. It would’ve been beautiful new, but the reality distortion field has no kind effect on ageing hardware. The transparent, acrylic case was cracked, but it still started up.</p>
<p>I’d had the best intentions of operating my own web server for years. What had stopped me was the lack of support for static IP addresses in consumer broadband packages and the lack of appropriate hardware. Now that <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/broadband/">O2</a> support static IP addresses in their consumer broadband packages, I had a chance. The Cube’s passively-cooled hardware, famously dispersing its heat by the convection of air through a vent that runs from the bottom of the system to the top, immediately appealed to me.</p>
<p>The Cube was old, though such machines can thrive as webservers. HTTP servers have been written for many platforms, including many aging systems and formats. The Cube wasn’t going to be the oldest webserver in the world by a long way. The <a href="http://www.c64web.com/">C64 webserver</a> is an example, although probably not the most archaic.</p>
<p>Its age did create a few problems. It came with a vintage install of Mac OS X 10.3 Panther. Panther felt surprisingly zippy and responsive when it booted, although it was too old to run MacPorts, Mac OS X’s popular open-source port project. To install <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, I would need OS X 10.4 Tiger as a minimum.</p>
<p>A copy of Tiger wasn’t hard to find. Once installed, the 2005-vintage operating system was thankfully responsive and stable. After installing MacPorts, it is simply a case of invoking the installation of PHP5, MySQL and Apache through the command-line interface.</p>
<p>It was here that the Cube really began to show its age. In total, it took the Cube the better part of twelve hours to compile and install the PHP/MySQL/Apache stack. I’m also feeling pinched for space – my Cube has a noisy 20GB hard disk drive, and the system files and applications account for around 10G alone.</p>
<p>That’s plenty for my needs, though. Now I have a web server of my own, that I can configure and operate to my heart’s content. I get good amounts of uptime, I get administrator access, I have no competing virtually-hosted sites draining performance.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a dusty piece of computer hardware that you’ve got in the back of a cupboard, I highly recommend that you try making your own webserver. <a href="http://2tbsp.com/content/install_apache_2_and_php_5_macports">You can find the guide that I used here</a>. MacPorts makes it easy. I daresay Apt is very friendly too. You’ll get so much value out of computers that up until yesterday did nothing.</p>
